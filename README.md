# Infrastructure-as-code-Project2

This project demonstrates how to create a Network infrastructure and server infrastructure in AWS using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools such as AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. The infrastructure includes an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Groups, which can help improve the scalability and availability of your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need the following:

* An AWS account
* The AWS CLI installed on your machine
* Access keys for your AWS account
* Basic knowledge of AWS services, CloudFormation, and Terraform

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the CloudFormation or Terraform file in a text editor of your choice.
3. Update the configuration parameters to match your AWS account settings and preferences.
4. Deploy the infrastructure using CloudFormation or Terraform.
5. Verify that the infrastructure has been deployed correctly by checking the AWS Console or running automated tests.

## Usage

Once the infrastructure has been deployed, you can use it to deploy your applications. You can also update the infrastructure configuration by updating the CloudFormation or Terraform file and re-deploying the changes.
